# To---Do-List
I developed a dynamic to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of the project is to allow users to add, manage, and remove tasks efficiently. The user interface is built with HTML and styled using CSS for a clean, responsive design. The core functionality, such as adding tasks, marking them as completed, and deleting tasks, is implemented using JavaScript. The application ensures a seamless user experience by updating the list interactively without page reloads.

This project helped me gain practical experience with DOM manipulation, event handling, and improving my skills in front-end development.
